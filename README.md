# React-Explorer
# Episode1 React Project

This project demonstrates basic usage of React to create and render elements dynamically. The project includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to set up and run a simple React application.

## Project Structure
  
### Files

- **App.js**: Contains the main React code to create and render nested elements.
- **index.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the project.
- **index.html**: A simple HTML file that demonstrates creating and appending an `h1` element using vanilla JavaScript.
- **indexReact.html**: An HTML file that sets up the environment for running the React application.

## Getting Started

To run the React application, open the `indexReact.html` file in a web browser. This file includes the necessary scripts to load React and ReactDOM, and it references the `App.js` file which contains the React code.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a modern web browser installed that supports ES6 and React.

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Episode1` directory.
3. Open `indexReact.html` in your web browser.

### Project Details

- **App.js**: This file uses `React.createElement` to create nested elements and renders them using `ReactDOM.render`. The structure includes two parent divs, each containing child divs with `h1` elements.

- **index.css**: This file contains a simple CSS rule to style an element with the id `heading`.

- **index.html**: This file demonstrates how to create and append an `h1` element to the DOM using vanilla JavaScript.

- **indexReact.html**: This file sets up the environment for running the React application. It includes the necessary scripts to load React and ReactDOM and references the `App.js` file.
